# MONOS-PT-DISEASE
The ponytown disease got me... they deleted my patreon and now im here
——————————

Frequently sitting at docks, feel free to say hi to me! I'm usually afk though so whispering will make me a lot more likely to see it. 

Regiment Retiree and a former staff of a number of Regiments. You may have known me as OMORI, BASIL, Mikaela, or Starsong. If you see me attending a regiment event.. check on my mental health /JOKE
I honestly.. Am not on Ponytown often so if you see me, especially alone and not with friends, consider it a rare sighting LOL

I hide and block freely and usually without warning, usually only temporarily but I may permahide/block if you do something greatly upsetting or if I have a personal issue with you.
